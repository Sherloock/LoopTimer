## Production example
# Copy this file to `.env.prod` locally (do not commit `.env.prod`)
#
# On Vercel you usually set these as Environment Variables instead of using `.env.prod`.
# For Postgres providers like Neon:
# - DATABASE_URL should typically be the pooled connection string
# - DIRECT_URL should typically be the direct/non-pooled connection string (for migrations)
# Both should include sslmode=require
#
# Example (replace with your real values):
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:5432/DB?schema=public&sslmode=require
DIRECT_URL=postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:5432/DB?schema=public&sslmode=require
