Always add to the beginning of your message "I understood the rules for project TIMER" before you start working on the task!

Every time you choose to apply a rule(s), explicitly state the rule(s) in the output. You can abbreviate the rule description to a single word or phrase.

If I use any of the following commands, you must generate the code for the command:
Commands = { "fiximp" => "fix all the imports in the project" }

## Project Context
This project is **TIMER**, its a workout timer
The system will allow users to create custom timers with loops etc

## Code style and structure
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasSolution)

## Tech Stack
- React
- NextJs 14.2.5
- TypeScript

- TailwindCSS
- Radix
- Shadcn UI
- Lucide Icons
- React Hook Form + Zod

- Prisma + Prisma Studio
- tanstack/react-query

## Syntax and Formatting
- Use TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Shadcn UI syntax and formatting guidelines
- Follow coding conventions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments to explain "why" behind the code when necessary (not for obvious things, ONLY FOR COMPLEX LOGIC)
- Keep functions small and focused (single responsibility)
- Always use import @/ for all imports (e.g. import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'), Don't use relative paths
- Always add id to toast messages like toast.success('Timer saved!',{ id: 'save-timer'})
- Use boolean casting like !!x instead of Boolean(x)
- ALWAYS wrap useSearchParams() in Suspense boundary: create separate component for useSearchParams logic, wrap in <Suspense fallback={...}> to prevent build errors
- Use @/components/ui/... for all import if possible so prefer SHADCN UI COMPONENTS instead of Radix UI components
- Use @/actions/... for all actions
- Use @/lib/... for all libraries
- Use @/types/... for all types
- Use @/hooks/... for all hooks
- Use @/utils/... for all utils
- Use @/schema/... for all zod schemas
- Use @/prisma for all prisma queries
- Use "const userId = checkAuth();" for all server actions (ROOT_FOLDER/actions/*) imported from import {checkAuth} from "@/actions/auth/authCheck";

## UI and Styling
- Use Shadcn UI components and styling
- Use TailwindCSS for styling
- Use TailwindCSS classes for styling
- On ICONS use Lucide Icons and SIZE them with size={20} or size={16} or size={12} DONT USE OTHER SIZES OR className='w-4 h-4'
- Always merge classes with the cn function
- Use rounded-lg as the standard border radius for buttons, cards, and UI elements (avoid rounded-full unless specifically needed for circular elements like avatars)
Prefer container-based visual grouping (border/background) for logical groupings, avoid indicators that consume layout space unless necessary for clarity.

always check version in package.json, and include the exact version in your answer
Always design and test for phones, tablets, and all screen sizes (responsive design).
Always use Lucide icons in all buttons, especially in dialogs and action bars, to improve clarity and user experience.
Always use inputMode="numeric" and pattern="[0-9:]*" for time/number inputs to improve mobile UX.
For mobile usability, prefer wider input fields (w-24 or more) and larger touch targets.
Add comments when overriding default component sizing for UX reasons.
Do not ask for confirmation before making changes that the user has explicitly requested.



AFTER YOU FINISH A TASK MAKE SURE TO SUGGESTING RULES FOR .cursorrule ADDITION.
