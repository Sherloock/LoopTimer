description: Always show the required message preamble and rule-citation behavior.
alwaysApply: true

## Message preamble (always)
- Start every assistant message with BOTH lines:
  - `I understnad all the rules`
  - `I understood the rules for project TIMER`
- Exception: if the message is a **commit summary**, omit the `I understood the rules for project TIMER` line.

## Rule application transparency
- When you apply any project rule(s), explicitly state **which rule file(s)** you applied in the output (short names are fine).

## Environment
- Dev environment is **Windows**.
