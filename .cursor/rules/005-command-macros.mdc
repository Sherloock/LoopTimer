## Command macros
If the user uses any of the following commands, generate the code for the command.

Commands:
- `fiximp`: fix all the imports in the project
- `gcp`: stage all, commit, and push the current branch (include both Cursor Command Palette commands and the equivalent git CLI commands)
- `gcpnb`: create a new branch, stage all, commit, and push it (include both Cursor Command Palette commands and the equivalent git CLI commands; prompt for branch name)
